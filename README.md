# How X do Y?

A minimal site that Googles how selected tech companies design a system. Check [it 👈🏻](howxdoy.vercel.app) out!

## Why the project?

Searching for system design ideas is much harder than finding a code snippet from Stack Overflow. Here is why:

**Google gives you popular (or highly SEO optimized) results, but they are not necessarily the best-written ones.**

But as a software engineer, you know a few tech companies that write better than others. Why not scope the search to find faster?

Here comes **How X Do Y**. You just type the search term, select companies of interest, press Enter, done.
