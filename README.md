# How X do Y?

## Motivation

I am a software engineer and I love copy-and-paste, from code snippet to system design.
Usually, I turn to Stack Overflow for code snippets, and browse through
tech blog posts by different tech companies for system design ideas.

Searching on Stack Overflow is simple, however, searching tech blog posts
among websites is not easy.

For example, to learn how tech giants build a feature store,
I google "Uber feature store", "Airbnb feature store", etc.
It works, but takes me a lot of processing to find the right ones.

Luckily, Google allows us to search across a specified set of domains,
though with a bit complex syntax.

How-X-Do-Y simplifies this.
